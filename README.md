1. Start by setting up Jenkins, SonarQube, ArgoCD, and JFrog Artifactory. You can use the tools' official documentation for guidance.
2. Configure a Jenkins pipeline to build your application, run tests, and perform code quality checks.
3. Utilize JFrog Artifactory to store and manage Docker images, Helm charts, and other artifacts.
4. Set up ArgoCD for continuous deployment, ensuring your application is automatically deployed to your Kubernetes cluster.
5. Document your project. Include detailed setup instructions, architecture diagrams, and any challenges you faced.
